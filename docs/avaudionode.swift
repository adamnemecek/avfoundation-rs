            only be done when attaching to an output bus which is not connected to another node; an
            error will result otherwise.
            The tap and connection formats (if non-nil) on the specified bus should be identical.

        @discussion
            Only one tap may be installed on any bus. Taps may be safely installed and removed while
            the engine is running.

            Note that if you have a tap installed on AVAudioOutputNode, there could be a mismatch
            between the tap buffer format and AVAudioOutputNode's output format, depending on the
            underlying physical device. Hence, instead of tapping the AVAudioOutputNode, it is
            advised to tap the node connected to it.

            E.g. to capture audio from input node:
    <pre>
    AVAudioEngine *engine = [[AVAudioEngine alloc] init];
    AVAudioInputNode *input = [engine inputNode];
    AVAudioFormat *format = [input outputFormatForBus: 0];
    [input installTapOnBus: 0 bufferSize: 8192 format: format block: ^(AVAudioPCMBuffer *buf, AVAudioTime *when) {
    // â€˜buf' contains audio captured from input node at time 'when'
    }];
    ....
    // start engine
    </pre>

            This property reflects the delay between when an impulse in the audio stream arrives at the
            input vs. output of the node. This should reflect the delay due to signal processing
            (e.g. filters, FFT's, etc.), not delay or reverberation which is being applied as an effect.

        @discussion
            This describes the maximum time it will take for the audio at the output of a node to be
            presented.
            For instance, the output presentation latency of the output node in the engine is:
                - zero in manual rendering mode
                - the presentation latency of the device itself when rendering to an audio device
                  (see `AVAudioIONode(presentationLatency)`)
            The output presentation latency of a node connected directly to the output node is the
            output node's presentation latency plus the output node's processing latency (see `latency`).

            For a node which is exclusively in the input node chain (i.e. not connected to engine's
            output node), this property reflects the latency for the output of this node to be
            presented at the output of the terminating node in the input chain.

            A value of zero indicates either an unknown or no latency.

            Note that this latency value can change as the engine is reconfigured (started/stopped,
            connections made/altered downstream of this node etc.). So it is recommended not to cache
            this value and fetch it whenever it's needed.
